The Corona Image Input/Output library is used internally by Basic4GL, and is distributed under the Zlib license (http://opensource.org/licenses/zlib-license.html or see the "ZLib LibPNG license.txt" file).


STANDALONE EXECUTABLES

Standalone executables created by Basic4GL are not considered to be under the FreeBSD license.
You may distribute and license them however you see fit, so long as the author of Basic4GL cannot be held liable for any damages caused. Specifically the "no warranty" clause of the FreeBSD license remains in effect:

Standalone executables created by Basic4GL contain the Corona Image Input/Output library, and the zlib license still applies to that part.

Standalone executables created by Basic4GL do NOT contain any Qt code.

Plugin libraries used by standalone executables may have their own licensing restrictions. You are responsible for determining and adhering to them.
