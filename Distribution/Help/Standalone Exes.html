<h1>Basic4GL standalone executables</h1>

<p>Basic4GL can take any Basic4GL program and create a Windows executable file.
This program can run on its own, and does not require Basic4GL to be installed.</p>

<h1>Creating the executable</h1>

<p>To create a stand-alone executable:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Start Basic4GL</li>
    <li>Open your Basic4GL program (File|Open...)</li>
    <li>Ensure it compiles and runs properly</li>
    <li>Click "File|Create Standalone .exe..."</li>
</ul>

<img src="Images\Standalone1.png"></img>
<p>The create standalone exe options dialog box will appear. You
can now configure how your exe will be created.</p>
<p>It is recommended you at least set the filename, so you can
choose a directory where you will be able to find the file once
it's created (otherwise by default the file will be created in
the same directory as the original Basic4GL source file.).</p>

<p>When you are ready, click &quot;OK&quot; to generate your exe file.</p>

<div class="extra-info">
	<h3>Generate file errors</h3>
	<p>Standalone exe file generation can fail. One common and simple reason is that you don't have access to create the file in the folder specified, due to Windows folder security.</p>
	<img src="Images\StandaloneError1.png"></img>
	<p>If this happens, try one of the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Choose a different folder that you do have write access to.</li>
		<li>Run Basic4GL "As Administrator" (if you can).</li>
		<li>Edit the folder permissions to give yourself write access (if you can).</li>
	</ul>
	</p>	
</div>

<p>Basic4GL will create the executable file, and display it in a Windows Explorer window.
You can then double click it to run the file.</p>

<h2>If your file doesn't run</h2>

<p>There are some common reasons a standalone executable might not run, or not run correctly.</p>

<h3>Missing asset files</h3>

<p>Be aware that your program may not run correctly if it requires files (such as images, sound files)
that it cannot access from the folder containing the standalone executable.</p>
<p>For example, if your program loads a texture from a relative folder, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="basic">dim myTex = LoadTex("data\ball.png")</code></pre>
<p>Then it will fail if the standalone executable's folder doesn't contain a subfolder "data" containing 
an image file "ball.png".</p>
<p>You will need to distribute these files along with your standalone executable, or as an "embedded file" 
inside the executable itself (see the <a href="#embedded-files">"Embedded Files" section</a> below).

<h3>Missing plugins</h3>

<p>If your program uses plugin libraries, then their DLLs, and any other resources that they use will need
to be copied into the standalone executable's folder as well. Otherwise the standalone executable file will not start.</p>

<div class="extra-info">
	<h3>Copying plugin files</h3>
	<p>Basic4GL does <em>not</em> try to automatically copy plugin library DLLs into the target folder for you. This is 
	because it does not know which files are actually required.</p>
	<p>A plugin library DLL often references other DLLs, and may have its own asset files that it loads
	at runtime. Instead of trying to guess (and likely getting it wrong much of the time) Basic4GL leaves
	it up to you to determine which files need to be distributed.</p>
	<p>Refer to the plugin library documentation to determine which files are required.</p>
</div>

<h3>B4GLSound.dll</h3>

<p>If your program plays sound effects or music, you must copy B4GLSound.dll into the standalone executable
file's folder. Otherwise no sound or music playback will occur (your program will be silent).</p>

<h1>Create standalone exe options</h1>

<p>There are several ways you can configure how the program will
work, and how and where it will be created. These are divided
into several tabbed pages in the &quot;Create standalone
exe&quot; dialog box.</p>

<h2>&quot;Program&quot; tab</h2>

<img src="Images\Standalone1.png"></img>

<p>This allows you to specify the output filename, and the window title (which is also shown when you Alt-Tab between applications).</p>
<p>By default the name of the Basic4GL program is used (i.e.
&quot;MyGame.gb&quot; will create a file &quot;MyGame.exe&quot;,
with a window title &quot;MyGame&quot;). If the Basic4GL program
hasn't been saved to disk yet, it will default to &quot;MyProgram.exe&quot; (filename) and &quot;MyProgram&quot; (display name).</p>

<h2>&quot;Options&quot; tab</h2>

<img src="Images\Standalone2.png"></img>

<p>This allows you to specify what will happen when the program
encounters a runtime error, or reaches the end of the program (or
an &quot;end&quot; command). There are two options:</p>

<h3>When the program finishes</h3>

<p>Some programs keep on executing until the user quits (presses
Escape or closes the window). Others will perform an action, display the results and then
finish.</p>

<p>Here you can specify whether it is appropriate to close the
program down immediately, or wait for a keypress (to give the
user time to look at the results on the screen) before closing.
You can also choose to keep the window open until the user closes
it by clicking on the close button. (This option does not apply
when in full screen mode.)</p>

<h3>If a runtime error occurs</h3>

<p>Typical runtime errors include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Reading off the end of an array</li>
    <li>Trying to access a null pointer</li>
    <li>Trying to access a variable that hasn't been DIMmed yet</li>
</ul>

<p>If an error like this occurs the Basic4GL program cannot
continue and must stop. In Basic4GL it would position the cursor
where the problem is and give a description of what went wrong.</p>
<p>Here you can specify what your standalone executable program should do.</p>

<h3>&quot;Esc&quot; or Closing Window quits</h3>

<p>Choose whether the program should stop if the user presses the "Esc" key on their keyboard, or 
clicks the "X" to close the window (if in Windowed mode).</p>
<p>If you have implemented your own quit function (using the BASIC "end" command), you may want to 
untick this option to prevent the program from inadvertently closing. Your program may have clean-up
logic to run before the user quits, such as saving preferences to a file, or just asking "are you sure?".</p>
<div class="extra-info">
	<h3>Include a quit function</h3>
	<p>If you untick this option, make sure you build a quit function into your program.</p>
	<p>Otherwise the user will not be able to close your program (besides killing it from the Windows Task Manager).</p>
</div>

<p>Example 1:</p>

    <PRE><CODE class="basic">printr &quot;Press Q to quit&quot;
while lcase$ (inkey$ ()) &lt;&gt; &quot;q&quot;

    ' Do something
    ' ...
                  
wend

' Cleanup 
' ...

printr &quot;Goodbye&quot;</CODE></PRE>

<p>Example 2:</p>

    <PRE><CODE class="basic">printr &quot;Press Q to quit&quot;
while true
    
    ' Do something
    ' ...
    
    if lcase$ (inkey$ ()) = &quot;q&quot; then

        ' Cleanup 
        ' ...

        printr &quot;Goodbye&quot;        
        end
    endif
wend</CODE></PRE>

<p>Basic4GL will simulate a VK_ESCAPE keypress if the user clicks
the close button on the window (in windowed mode).<br>
You can detect this as follows:</p>

    <PRE><CODE class="basic">if InScanKey () = VK_ESCAPE then
    
    ' User wants to quit
    ' ...

endif</CODE></PRE>

<h2>&quot;Screen Mode&quot; tab</h2>

<img src="Images\Standalone3.png"></img>

<p>Choose the screen mode your program will run in. This is similar to the Basic4GL runtime options dialog box.</p>

<p>Some options are only applicable in certain configurations. For example the "Colour depth" can only be 
specified if you are in full screen mode (in windowed mode, the desktop colour depth will always be used).
These options will be grayed out when not applicable.</p>

<h3>"Resolution", "Colour depth" and "Full screen"</h3>

<p>These are the main options for defining the window behaviour.</p>

<h3>"Border around window" and "Allow resizing"</h3>

<p>These allow extra control of how the window will behave in windowed mode.</p>
<p>The window border shows the title and the maximize, minimize and close buttons.</p>
<p>"Allow resizing" means that the user can drag the sides/corners of the window to change its size.</p>

<h3>"Enable stencil buffer"</h3>
<p>This is an advanced option, and only required if you are writing OpenGL
code that uses the OpenGL stencil buffer. (Otherwise leave it un-ticked.)</p>

<h3>Startup</h3>
<p>You can also choose not to create an OpenGL window <em>at all</em> when your program starts up.
In this case no window is displayed until your program creates one with the UpdateWindow() command.</p>
<p>This can be useful if your program lets the user choose the window resolution (and maybe writes the
settings to a file that it loads when it starts up).</p>
<p>Alternatively your program doesn't use the OpenGL window at all, such as run-and-quit programs that
operate on files etc.</p>

<div class="extra-info">
	<h3>Important!</h3>
	<p>Be careful not to execute any OpenGL, text or sprite commands before the OpenGL window has been
	created. Otherwise your program will error with "An exception has occurred", and stop.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="embedded-files">&quot;Embedded Files&quot; tab</h2>

<img src="Images\Standalone4.png"></img>

<p>Many programs require extra files in order to run properly,
such as textures and data files. If the program cannot find them,
it won't run correctly and may not run at all.</p>

<p>Normally this means you have to distribute all these files
separately, either in a compressed archive (like a zip file) or
using some sort of installer.</p>

<p>Basic4GL has an &quot;Embedded Files&quot; mechanism which can
simplify this by storing the support files directly into the
executable file itself. These files load automatically whenever
the program loads in a file with the same filename - for example
using LoadTex, LoadSound or OpenFileRead - so you don't need
to change your program to make it work.</p>
<p>If the file isn't found inside the executable, the program will
attempt to load it from disk as per normal.</p>

<h3>Default embedded files</h3>

<p>Basic4GL will attempt to guess which files your program uses by scanning for text strings that 
match up to filenames on your disk, and add them to the embedded files list automatically.</p>
<p>However this is a fairly primitive algorithm, and does not always detect all files used. For example:</p>
<PRE><CODE class="basic">dim path$, filename$, tex
path$ = "textures"
filename$ = "00001.jpg"
tex = LoadTexture(path$ + "\" + filename$)</CODE></PRE>

<p>Will load a texture called &quot;textures\00001.jpg&quot;, but Basic4GL will not detect this as it sees
&quot;textures&quot; and &quot;00001.jpg&quot; separately. If you want this file to be embedded, you must add it manually.</p>

<p>Alternatively you may prefer to distribute files normally, and not to embed them at all. In this 
case you should remove them from the list, so that they don't make the executable file 
unnecessarily large.</p>

<h3>Adding embedded files</h3>

<p>Click the &quot;Add...&quot; button, browse to the
files you want to include, select them and click
&quot;Open&quot;. Do this as many times as necessary.<br>
<em>Note: Simply adding a file doesn't mean that the program will
use it. You still have to write the Basic4GL code to load and use
the file. Otherwise it will sit in the executable and waste
space.</em></p>

<h3>Deleting embedded files</h3>

<p>Sometimes you don't want to use the embedded files mechanism.</p>
<p>For example, you may want to distribute an image separately so
that the user can edit it and customise their game.</p>
<p>Also embedded files are loaded into memory as soon as the program
starts (even if they aren't used), and will use this memory until
the program exits. If you have a large number of data files you
may want to load them in as they are required and then free them
up once you are finished with them. In this case distributing the
files separately might be a better idea.</p>

<p>To remove files from the embedded files list, select
them and click &quot;Remove&quot;.</p>

<h1>About the executable file</h1>

<p>A few other things to be aware of:</p>

<h2>Not machine code</h2>
<p>Basic4GL standalone executable files are <em>not</em> compiled to machine code.</p>
<p>They contain the same virtual machine as the Basic4GL editor, and run the same op-codes exactly 
the same way as the Basic4GL editor.</p>
<p>This means that standalone executable files do not run any faster than the same program running
in Basic4GL itself.</p>

<h2>File size</h2>

<p>Even simple Basic4GL programs create standalone executables of at least 1.2 megabytes.</p>
<p>This is because all standalone executables contain:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Basic4GL virtual machine</li>
	<li>All the Basic4GL runtime libraries</li>
	<li>The Basic4GL compiler (for runtime compilation)</li>
	<li>The charset.png texture</li>
</ul>
<p>These are contained in every standalone executable regardless if they are used or not.</p>

<h1>Licensing</h1>

<p>Refer to the "STANDALONE EXECUTABLES" section of License.txt distributed with Basic4GL for 
licensing and distribution of standalone executables created with Basic4GL.</p>
