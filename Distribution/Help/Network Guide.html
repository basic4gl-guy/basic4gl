<H1>The Basic4GL network engine</H1>
<div class="extra-info">
	<h3>Custom network protocol</h3>
	<p>Basic4GL does not support regular TCP/IP networking, or common protocols such as ftp or http 
	(although some of these have been implemented by 3rd party plugins).</p>
	<p>The Basic4GL network routines use their own custom protocol, built on top of UDP/IP. You can 
	use it to write programs that network with other Basic4GL programs, but not (for example) to 
    write an FTP client.</p>
</div>
<div class="extra-info">
	<h3>IP v6 not supported</h3>
	<p>Please be aware that IP v6 is not supported at this time.</p>
</div>
<P>The Basic4GL network engine is designed primarily for writing low latency networked games. It 
allows you to establish a network connection between two running Basic4GL 
programs and send blocks of data (which we call "messages") back and 
forth. Basic4GL will attempt to send these messages as quickly as possible 
(with some extra logic for reliability and/or ordering if required).</P>
<P>And that's all it does.</P>
<P>It is up to you to decide what data to send, how to send it, and how often. But with a bit of planning it is possible to write some responsive multiplayer lan or internet games without too much fuss.</P>
<P>The network engine uses UDP/IP packets for communication. Any network that 
can do TCP/IP can do UDP/IP (as TCP is built on top of UDP), so your programs 
can run over the Internet and TCP/IP local networks.</P>
<P>Basic4GL uses its own protocol for handling connection lifetime and reliable 
packet delivery which is optimised towards writing responsive networked games. 
It lets you choose which messages <em>must</em> get through and which ones don't 
matter if they get lost on the way. You can also choose which messages 
<em>must</em> arrive in the same order they were sent and which ones don't matter 
so much. This upshot of this is that a carefully designed application will 
have the best chance to be able to continue smoothly if a data packet is lost in 
transmission, which is important for realtime games. (Unlike TCP/IP which has to 
stop for a few seconds if it hits an error). The downside is because the 
Basic4GL network engine uses its own protocol it can only talk to other 
applications using the same protocol, i.e. other Basic4GL programs.</P>
<P>The network engine supports:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Automatic connection lifetime handling (using "timeouts" and 
  "keep-alives") 
  <LI>Reliable/unreliable messages 
  <LI>Ordered/unordered messages 
  <LI>Automatic message fragmentation and reassembly 
  <LI>Optional "message smoothing" compensates for varying network latency to 
  ensure messages are received and applied smoothly. </LI></UL>
<H2>Reading/writing messages with File I/O functions</H2>
<P>The bulk of a program's network code usually involves:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Writing some data to a "message", then sending down a network connection.</li> 
  <LI>Receiving a "message" from a network connection and reading the data 
  inside it. </LI></UL>
<P>A network message is a block of data, similar to a small disk file. In fact 
Basic4GL uses the file I/O functions to read and write the contents of network 
messages. Instead of using OpenFileWrite and OpenFileRead, you use 
SendMessage and ReceiveMessage, but otherwise it's just like accessing a disk 
file.</P>
<P>Compare this program to write a simple text file:</P>
<PRE><CODE class="basic">dim file
file = OpenFileWrite("files\test.txt") ' Open a file for output
WriteString(file, "Some text")         ' Write some text
CloseFile(file)                        ' Close the file</CODE></PRE>
<P>With this program to send a message over a network connection:</P>
<PRE><CODE class="basic">dim msg
...
msg = SendMessage(connection)          ' Create a message to send down connection
WriteString(msg, "Some text")          ' Write some text
CloseFile(msg)                         ' Send the message</CODE></PRE>
<P>(Note: The above program is incomplete...)</P>
<P>All of Basic4GL's file I/O functions except "OpenFileRead" and 
"OpenFileWrite" can be used with Basic4GL network messages. These functions 
are described in the File I/O section of the Basic4GL <A href="Programmers Guide.html#file-io">Programmer's Guide</A>.</P>
<H1>Server-client connections</H1>
<P>Two connect two computer over a network, you must do the following:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>One computer is chosen as the "server". The other is the "client". 
  <LI>The server listens on a network port number for connection requests. 
  <LI>The client creates a new connection and connects it to the server's port. 
  <LI>The server accepts the connection, creating a corresponding connection at 
  its own end. </LI></UL>
<P>At this point both the client and the server have a "connection" with which 
they can send and receive data. Data sent down the server's connection will 
be received by the client's connection and vice versa.</P>
<P>(Note: This can be extended to connect multiple computers together, by having 
one as the server and having the rest of them as clients that connect to the 
server. In this case the server will have multiple "connection"s, one for each 
client.)</P>
<H1>Servers and server connections</H1>
<H2>NewServer</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>NewServer(<EM>port</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>port </EM>is the port number on which the server "listen"s for 
connection requests.<BR>NewServer() creates a server and returns a handle to 
identify the server to other functions (such as AcceptConnection()).</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE><CODE class="basic">dim server
server = NewServer(8000)   ' Create a new server on port 8000

' ... Run the program

DeleteServer(server)       ' Close and delete the server</CODE></PRE>
<H2>DeleteServer</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>DeleteServer(<EM>server</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>server</EM> is a server handle returned from NewServer().<BR>Shuts 
down and deletes the server. Any connections accepted by the server will 
automatically be disconnected and deleted.</P>
<P>It is good practice to close server objects (and connections) when finished 
with them.<BR>If not closed explicitly, Basic4GL will automatically close them 
when the program ends.</P>
<H2>ConnectionPending</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>ConnectionPending(<EM>server</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>server</EM> is a server handle returned from NewServer().</P>
<P>ConnectionPending() returns true if a client has asked for a connection to 
the server and is waiting for the server to accept or reject it.<BR>The 
connection can now be accepted with AcceptConnection() or rejected with 
RejectConnection().</P>
<H2>AcceptConnection</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>AcceptConnection(<EM>server</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>server</EM> is a server handle returned from NewServer().</P>
<P>AcceptConnection() accepts a pending connection request, creates a 
corresponding connection object and returns a handle for it.<BR>If no connection 
is pending, AcceptConnection() does nothing and returns 0.</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE><CODE class="basic">const port = 8000
dim server, connection

' Create server
server = NewServer(port)
printr "Server created. Waiting for connections"

' Wait for incoming connections
while true
    if ConnectionPending(server) then
        printr "Connection accepted"
    
        ' Accept connection
        connection = AcceptConnection(server)
        
        ' ... Do something here
        Sleep(1000)
        
        ' Close connection now that we're finished
        DeleteConnection(connection)
    endif
wend</CODE></PRE>
<H2>RejectConnection</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>RejectConnection(<EM>server</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>server</EM> is a server handle returned from NewServer().</P>
<P>Rejects an incoming connection request.</P>
<p>It is good practice to reject any pending connections when you know that you cannot handle them - for example if your server already has all the connections it can handle. The client connection will
disconnect immediately rather than wait and eventually timeout from receiving no response.</p>
<p>Rejecting the connection also removes it from the pending connection queue, so if your server is able
to accept connections again later on it will not see the old pending connection request.</p>
<H1>Client connections</H1>
<H2>NewConnection</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>NewConnection(<EM>address</EM>, <EM>port</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Creates a new connection and attempts to connect to a server at the specified 
address and port.<BR><EM>address</EM> is a text string specifying the network 
name to connect to. It can either be a DNS address (e.g. "someserver.com"), a 
numeric IP address (e.g. "192.168.0.1") or "localhost" (meaning connect to the 
same computer).<BR><EM>port</EM> is the port number. It must be the same one as 
the server is listening on, otherwise it wont find the server.</P>
<P>NewConnection() returns a handle identifying the connection that can be 
passed to other functions (such as SendMessage()).</P>
<H2>DeleteConnection</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>DeleteConnection(<EM>connection</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>connection</EM> is a connection handle returned by NewConnection() 
or AcceptConnection().</P>
<P>Deletes a network connection.<BR>If the connection is active, it will be 
closed, and a notification sent to the corresponding connection at the other end 
to inform it of the close.</P>
<P>Basic4GL also automatically closes and deletes any outstanding network 
connections when the program finishes.</P>
<H1>Connection state</H1>
<p>Programs should monitor the "connection state" of their connections, especially to detect whether the connection has become disconnected, which happens if either end call DeleteConnection(), or if the  connection has been disconnected somehow.</p>
<p>Client connections follow this pattern:
<ol><li>NewConnection() called</li>
<li>Handshaking</li>
<li>Connected</li>
<li><em>(Connection used to send/receive messages)</em></li>
<li>Disconnected</li></ol>
</p>
<p>Or if the connection is not accepted:
<ol><li>NewConnection() called</li>
<li>Handshaking</li>
<li>Disconnected</li></ol>
</p>
<p>Server accepted connections are similar to client connections, except they are never in the "Handshaking" state (the connection is considered connected as soon as AcceptConnection() is called):
<ol><li>AcceptConnection() called</li>
<li>Connected</li>
<li><em>(Connection used to send/receive messages)</em></li>
<li>Disconnected</li></ol>
</p>
<p>The following functions are used to detect the different states.</p>
<H2>ConnectionConnected</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>ConnectionConnected(<EM>connection</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>connection</EM> is a connection handle returned by NewConnection() 
or AcceptConnection().</P>
<P>ConnectionConnected() returns true if the connection is still connected, or 
false if the connection has been disconnected.<BR>Connections are considered 
"connected" when they are created, and remain that way until either:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The connection is closed at the other end (by DeleteConnection()), or 
  <LI>The connection times out due to lack of network activity.<BR>(Note: This 
  does <EM>not</EM> mean that you have to keep sending network messages to 
  prevent a connection timing out. The network engine automatically sends "keep 
  alive" notifications if necessary to inform the other side that the connection 
  is still alive.) </LI></UL>
<H2>ConnectionHandshaking</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>ConnectionHandshaking(<EM>connection</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>connection</EM> is a connection handle returned by NewConnection() 
or AcceptConnection().</P>
<P>Returns true if the connection is in the hand-shaking state.</P>
<P>Connections created by NewConnection() are considered to be "hand-shaking" 
until the server accepts the connection (and the confirmation notification is 
received).<BR>Once the connection is established, it leaves the hand-shaking 
state (ConnectionHandshaking() will then return false), and the connection is 
ready to send and receive messages.</P>
<P>Note: Server connections created with AcceptConnection() do not have a 
hand-shaking phase. For these ConnectionHandshaking() will always return false, as the connection is fully established as soon as it has been accepted.</P>
<H2>ConnectionAddress</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>ConnectionAddress(<EM>connection</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>connection</EM> is a connection handle returned by 
NewConnection() or AcceptConnection().</P>
<P>Returns the IP address of the computer at the other end of the 
network connection, in numeric format (e.g. "192.168.0.1").</P>
<H1>Sending messages</H1>
<P>Data is passed through connections as "messages", variable length blocks of 
data which are transmitted and received as a single item.</P>
<H2>SendMessage</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>SendMessage(<EM>connection</EM>, <EM>channel</EM>, <EM>reliable</EM>, 
  <EM>smoothed</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>connection</EM> is a connection handle returned by NewConnection() 
or AcceptConnection().</P>
<P>SendMessage() creates a message ready to be sent down <EM>connection</EM>, 
and returns a handle representing the message.<BR>You can then pass this handle 
to the Write...() file I/O functions (WriteByte(), WriteString(), etc) to write 
data to the message, just as you would write data to a file. Refer to 
the file I/O functions in the Basic4GL <a href="Programmers Guide.html#file-io">Programmers' Guide</A>
for more information.</P>
<P>Once the message is ready, call CloseFile() to close the message and send 
it.</P>
<P>SendMessage() has 3 options which affect message delivery:</P>
<h3>Channel</h3>
<P>Channel is a "channel number" and affects the order in which messages are 
received.</P>
<p>Depending on network conditions messages can arrive at the 
receiving end in a different order than which they were sent. For example a message 
(or part of a message) may be lost in transmission and have to 
be resent, delaying it long enough for other messages to get in 
infront of it.</p>
<p>The Basic4GL network engine supports ordering of messages 
through "channels". Every connection has 32 channels (numbered 0 through 31 
inclusive). Messages sent within a single channel are guaranteed to be received in 
the same order as they were sent - with the exception of channel # 0 which is the unordered channel.</p>
<p>Two messages sent down different channels are <EM>not</EM> guaranteed to be received 
in the same order.</P>
<P>The multiple channels to allow you to specify for which messages the 
ordering is important. A good choice of channels can affect network performance, 
especially over unreliable networks (such as an internet connection). If an 
ordered message is delayed, the whole channel will stall until the message is 
received and slotted into its correct order. However other channels will still 
keep receive messages. So if a game was using on ordered channel for chat 
messages, and a <EM>different</EM> channel for position updates, the engine can 
keep receiving position updates even if a chat message is lost and must be 
re-transmitted.</P>
<h3>Reliable</h3>
<P>Reliable is true if the message <em>must</em> be delivered.</p>
<p>Depending on network conditions, some messages may be lost in transmission. The reliable flag 
specifies whether this is acceptable for this message (reliable = false) or 
whether the message must get through, in which case the network 
engine will keep resending the packet until delivery is confirmed.</P>
<h3>Smoothed</h3>
<p>Packet "smoothing" attempts to smooth out the network lag by measuring the average amount of time
it takes for packets to arrive, and occasionally delaying early arriving packets before releasing 
them to the application.</p>
<p>This can result in a smoother experience (especially for messages conveying position updates and 
game events), but be aware that it does add extra latency to some packets.</p>
<H1>Receiving messages</H1>
<H2>MessagePending</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>MessagePending(<EM>connection</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>connection</EM> is a connection handle returned by NewConnection() 
or AcceptConnection().</P>
<P>MessagePending() returns true if a message has been received and can be 
fetched with ReceiveMessage().</P>
<H2>MessageChannel</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>MessageChannel(<EM>connection</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>connection</EM> is a connection handle returned by NewConnection() 
or AcceptConnection().</P>
<P>MessageChannel() returns the channel number of the pending message. (See 
SendMessage() for more information).</P>
<H2>MessageReliable</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>MessageReliable(<EM>connection</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>connection</EM> is a connection handle returned by NewConnection() 
or AcceptConnection().</P>
<P>MessageReliable() returns whether the pending message was sent as a reliable 
message (MessageReliable() = true) or as an unreliable message. (See 
SendMessage() for more information).</P>
<H2>MessageSmoothed</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>MessageSmoothed(<EM>connection</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>connection</EM> is a connection handle returned by NewConnection() 
or AcceptConnection().</P>
<P>MessageSmoothed() returns whether the pending message was sent as a smoothed 
message (MessageSmoothed() = true) or not. (See SendMessage() for more 
information).</P>
<H2>ReceiveMessage</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>ReceiveMessage(<EM>connection</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>connection</EM> is a connection handle returned by NewConnection() 
or AcceptConnection().</P>
<P>ReceivedMessage() fetches the current pending message from the connection and 
returns a handle representing the message.<BR>You can then pass this handle to 
the Read...() file I/O functions (ReadByte(), ReadChar(), etc) to read data from 
the message, just as you would read data from a file. The Seek() and EndOfFile() 
functions may also be used. Refer to the file I/O functions in the 
Basic4GL <a href="Programmers Guide.html#file-io">Programmers' 
Guide</a> for more information.</P>
<P>Once you have finished with the message, you should discard it with 
CloseFile(), in order to free up resources.</P>

<H1>Connection and handshaking flags</H1>
<P>There are two flags which indicate the current connection state of a 
connection:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Connected (see function: ConnectionConnected()) 
  <LI>Handshaking (see function: ConnectionHandshaking()) </LI></OL>
<H2>Client connections</H2>
<P>When a client connection is created with NewConnection(), <EM>connected</EM> 
and <EM>handshaking</EM> are both set.<BR>If the connection succeeds, 
<EM>connected</EM> remains set, and <EM>handshaking</EM> is cleared.<BR>If the 
connection fails (either rejected by the server, or times out), 
<EM>connected</EM> is cleared. (<EM>handshaking</EM> may remain set 
though...)</P>
<P>Thus the code to establish a client connection might look something like 
this:</P>
<PRE><CODE class="basic">dim connection, address$, port

' Get connection details
print "Address?:": address$ = input$()
print "Port?:": port = val(input$())

' Attempt to connect to server
printr "Connecting..."
connection = NewConnection(address$, port)
while ConnectionConnected(connection) and ConnectionHandshaking(connection): wend

' Check if succeeded
if ConnectionConnected(connection) then
    printr "Connection succeeded"
    ' Do something with connection
    ' ...
else
    printr "Connection failed"
endif

' Close connection
DeleteConnection(connection)</CODE></PRE>
<P>If you attempt to use a connection while in the handshaking stage the network 
engine will do it's best to accomodate this. Specifically:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Outgoing messages will not be sent immediately. Instead they will be 
  placed in a queue until the connection is established, and then sent. 
  <LI>No messages will be received until the connection is established. </LI></UL>
<H2>Server connections</H2>
<P>When a server connection is created with AcceptConnection(), <EM>connected 
</EM>is set and <EM>handshaking</EM> is cleared.<BR>The connection is considered 
established and can be used immediately.</P>
<H1>Connection settings</H1>
<P>Network connections have a number of parameters which affect how they behave 
and perform in different network conditions. These affect timeouts, automatic 
resends, timing and also have an effect on the amount of bandwidth used. Often 
you will not need to configure these parameters as they have defaults should 
work in a number of different network conditions. However they are available 
should you need them.</P>
<P>Be careful when adjusting connection settings, as they can cause the network 
connection to fail if setup incorrectly.</P>
<P>Connection settings can be changed after a connection is created (with 
NewConnection or AcceptConnection).</P>
<H2>SetConnectionTimeout</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>SetConnectionTimeout(<EM>milliseconds</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>milliseconds</EM> is the number of milliseconds after which 
a connection times out and disconnects if no response is received from the other 
side.<BR>The default is 60000 (60 seconds).</P>
<H2>SetConnectionHandshakeTimeout</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>SetConnectionHandshakeTimeout(<EM>milliseconds</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Where <EM>milliseconds</EM>is the number of milliseconds after which 
a connection attempt will timeout if no reply is received from the 
server.<BR>The default is 10000 (10 seconds).</P>
<H2>SetConnectionKeepAlive</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>SetConnectionKeepAlive(<EM>milliseconds</EM>)</P></div>
<P>If the connection has not sent anything for&nbsp;this amount of time 
it will automatically send a "keep alive" message to let the other end know that 
it is still connected. This prevents the connection from timing out at the other 
end.</P>
<p>How often keep alive messages need to be send depends on the connection time-out, as well as the
network latency, and packet loss. Setting it to a quarter of the connection time-out (for example),
will give the network engine 3 or 4 attempts to get the keep-alive packet through before the 
connection times out.</p>
<p>If your program already sends a constant stream of network traffic (e.g. position updates in a 
real time game) then that traffic will keep the connection alive, and explicit "keep-alive" packets 
are not important.</p>
<H2>SetConnectionReliableResend</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>SetConnectionReliableResend(<EM>milliseconds</EM>)</P></div>
<P>This affects sending of reliable messages. When a reliable messages 
is sent, the connection will continually send the message until it receives 
confirmation from the other end that the message has been delivered. This 
setting controls how long the connection waits before resending the message. The 
default is 200 (0.2 seconds).</P>
<P>The lower this value is, the less delay there will be when packet 
loss occurs. However setting the value lower than the ping time will use up 
extra bandwidth, as a reliable message will be sent twice (or more) before the 
confirmation notification is received.</P>
<H2>SetConnectionDuplicates</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>SetConnectionDuplicates(<EM>count</EM>)</P></div>
<P>Specifies the number of times each message is duplicated when sent. 
The default is 1.<BR>Setting this number higher decreases the likelyhood of 
packet loss at the cost of extra bandwidth.</P>
<H2>SetConnectionSmoothingPercentage</H2>
<P>Format:</P>
<div class="format">
  <P>SetConnectionSmoothingPercentage(<EM>percentage</EM>)</P></div>
<p>This setting only affects packets that have been sent with the "smoothing" parameter set to true.</p>
  <P>The "smoothing" timing algorithm attempts to add artificial lag such 
that this percentage of packets arrive on time.&nbsp;The defaut is 80 
(percent).</p>
<p>Setting this number lower will decrease artificial lag but 
decreases "smoothness", whereas setting it higher will increase artificial 
lag and increase "smoothness".</P></BODY></HTML>
