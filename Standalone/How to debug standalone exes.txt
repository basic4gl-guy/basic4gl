The easiest way to debug a standalone exe is as follows:

1. Use the StandaloneCB2.bpr C++ Builder project to build StandaloneCB2.exe.

2. Copy the file ..\distribution\stub.bin.

3. Run Basic4GL and use the create standalone executable option.

4. SAVE THE STANDALONE EXECUTABLE BACK OVER THE TOP OF STANDALONECB2.EXE!

5. You can now debug the executable in C++ Builder as per normal!
