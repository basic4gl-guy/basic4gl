Building Basic4GL 								   9/may/2016 Tom Mulgrew (tmulgrew@slingshot.co.nz)
================= 

You can build Basic4GL with Visual Studio.
The solution file Basic4GL\Basic4GL.sln builds with Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition.

You will first need to install Qt version 5.5 https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/
And also the Visual Studio addin for Qt 5 from here http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-7

You will need to edit the Basic4GL\Basic4GL.vcxproj.user file, and change this line:
    
	<QTDIR>E:\Projects\clibraries\Qt\5.5\msvc2013</QTDIR>

To point to your Qt install's msvc2013 subfolder (you'll need to change it twice, once for Debug 
config and once for Release config).


Projects
--------

"Basic4GL" builds the main IDE.
"Standalone" builds the standalone.exe "Stub". This is basically an executable containing the 
Basic4GL virtual machine and libraries, with startup code to find and run the compiled BASIC 
program from a Win32 resource. To create the executable Basic4GL just needs to copy the stub, and 
use the Windows API to write the the compiled BASIC program as a resource.

There are also special builds of the corona and glfw libraries.
This is because Basic4GL uses msvc in a shared library (so that it can link cleanly with Qt, which 
does the same).
However the standalone exe has msvc compiled into it (so that there's fewer files to distribute).
So there are different builds of corona and glfw with shared and non shared msvc in order to link in
cleanly.


A note on the .pro file
-----------------------

The Qt .pro file doesn't build. However it's useful for editing the .ui files in Qt Creator, as 
the form editor when invoked from Visual Studio doesn't handle slot mappings as well.
So I tend to jump between Qt creator for form editing and Visual Studio for building/debugging.
