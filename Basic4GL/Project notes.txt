The Basic4GL IDE is linked using the Multithreaded DLL switch.
This means msvcr120.dll must be distributed.

The Standalone exe stub is linked using the Multithreaded switch (i.e. NOT DLL).
This is so that msvcr120.dll is NOT required for standalone exes.

Because both projects use the corona_static library, two versions of the library are built, 
one for each switch.
